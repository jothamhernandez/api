# Backend part - example solution

## Project setup
```bash
composer install
```

Import the database from `tests/php/data/db-dump.sql` or run the PHP API Tests once to have a dummy database.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and modify it to your needs (specially the database connection, use host `mysql` if you are using the docker-compose setup).
